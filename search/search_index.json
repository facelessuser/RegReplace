If you've enabled the use of the Regex library, see Regex's documentation.</p> <p>Please note in the documentation the slight syntax differences in each regular expression library. Regex and Backrefs (with Regex or Re) handles things like <code>r'\\u0057'</code> in a replace template and converts it to Unicode, while Re will not and requires something like <code>\"\\u0057\"</code> to represent Unicode (note that one is using Python raw strings and the other is not).  What this means in respect to RegReplace is that for Re you may have to use actual Unicode characters or represent Unicode in the JSON settings file differently; for Regex, you can use <code>\"\\\\u0057\"</code>, and in Re you will have to use <code>\"\\u0057\"</code> (JSON's notation for a literal Unicode character). There is one exception with Regex though: \"format\" replace (without Backrefs) will not handle <code>\"\\\\u0057\"</code>, and it will not handle <code>\"\\\\n\"</code>, but will also need literal characters like <code>\"\\u0057\"</code> and <code>\"\\n\"</code>.</p>"},{"location":"usage/#create-find-and-replace-sequences","title":"Create Find and Replace Sequences","text":"<p>In order to use them, replacements must be defined in the <code>reg_replace_rules.sublime-settings</code> file.</p> <p>There are two types of rules that can be created: scope rules (with optional scope qualifiers) and scope searches that apply regular expressions to the targeted scopes.

In this example, the first two selections will be inserted in <code>{}</code>: <code>r'Some value selection0 some [\\w]+ selection1'</code>.</p> <p>To control which selection goes where, you can explicitly set the index: <code>r'Some value {1} some [\\w]+ {0}'</code> \u2192. <code>r'Some value selection1 some [\\w]+ selection0'</code>. Or alternatively: <code>r'Some value {sel[1]} some [\\w]+ {sel[0]}'</code> (<code>sel</code> is the selection list).</p> <p>By default, the selection is just inserted into the pattern raw.  This is fine for literal searches, but for regex this is bad if your selection is something like: <code>something(else)</code>.  This example would be interpreted as adding a group containing <code>else</code>. So if this is not intended, the text would need to be escaped. So a new conversion type has been added to the format template: <code>!e</code>.  This new conversion type will insert the selection into the pattern after first escaping it.  So you could use it like so: <code>r'Some value {1!e} some [\\w]+ {0!e}'</code>, and the selection inputs would be escaped.</p> <p>For the sake of avoiding bad situations, RegReplace will limit the length of selections to the arbitrary value of 256, but you can configure this with the global setting <code>selection_input_max_size</code> in <code>reg_replace.sublime-settings</code>. Also, the number of allowed inputs will be limited to 10, but this can be tweaked via the setting <code>selection_input_max_count</code>.</p> <pre><code>    // Limit size of selections for inputs.\n    \"selection_input_max_size\": 256,\n\n    // Limit number of selections for inputs.\n    \"selection_input_max_count\": 10,\n</code></pre> <p>This should go without saying, but this is incompatible if you have the global option <code>selection_only</code> set which will search in selection content.  Though you can ignore it per command via the command parameter <code>no_selection</code>. So if you are constructing a chain that uses selection inputs, you can temporarily disable it with <code>no_selection</code>.</p>"},{"location":"usage/#a-better-way-to-create-regex-rules","title":"A Better Way to Create Regex Rules","text":"<p>A new feature was recently added that allows editing regular expression rules in a panel with Python syntax highlighting, providing a friendlier editing experience.
